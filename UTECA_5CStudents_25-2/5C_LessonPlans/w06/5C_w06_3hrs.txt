HW_04.1 [Due: 27 Feb 2025]
Begin your personal translation dictionary. Go back through the economic terms we have discussed thus far and enter any unfamiliar terms in your dictionary. Be sure to provide Spanish and English translations and definitions.

HW_04.2 [Due: 27 Feb 2025]
Read Hall and Lieberman, BANK FAILURES AND BANKING PANICS (pp 725-728). Provide a very brief summary of this section (English and Spanish) and answer the following questions:
	1. Do you think that an FDIC-like system is a good idea? Explain.
	2. The analogous entity to the FDIC in Mexico is the Instituto Para La Proteccion al Ahorro
Bancario (IPAB). Read the first few pages of S&P's Global Ratings Report for the IPAB. Is the IPAB a fiscally sound institution? Explain. 

Standard format applies.

Cloud services cut both ways in terms of security: you get off-site backup and disaster recovery, but you entrust your secrets to somebody else's hands. Doing the latter increases your exposure to government surveillance and the potential for deliberate or inadvertent breaches of your confidential files.
