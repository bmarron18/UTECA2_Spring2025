HW_06.1	[Due 13 Mar 2025]
Standard format applies.  

--- Task 1
Read Hall and Lieberman, pp. 854-857. Answer the following questions in English:

	1. What is a share of stock?
	2. What is the difference between bonds and stocks?
	3. Why do individuals choose to hold their wealth in stocks?
	4. The authors state, "By early 2000, the average U.S. household held more wealth in the stock market than in real estate, 
	including the value of their own home." Do you consider stock investments a wise choice? Explain.
	5. Explain the data in Table 1 on p. 857. 

--- Task 2
Read EXCERPT_WorldBank_StockMarket-vs-Economic-Development.txt and translate the entire excerpt into Spanish.


--- Task 3
Read i) EXCERPT_China_StockMarket-vs-Economic-Development.txt, and ii) EXCERPT_Mexco_StockMarket-vs-Economic-Development.txt.
Based on the three excerpts you have read, answer the following questions in English:

	1. Why does the stock market matter? What is its role in the economy? 
	2. Do evidence and data support the claim that there is a strong empirical association between stock market development and long-term 
	economic growth?

	ownership impedes effective corporate governance?

Market Classifications 
[rating scale 0 - 100]
######################
	Perfect Competition	<== 0
		* There are large numbers of buyers and sellers, and each buys or sells only 
		a tiny fraction of the total quantity in the market
		* Sellers offer a standardized product
		* Sellers can easily enter into or exit from the market; minimal or no barriers
		* Short-run profits


	Monopoly <== 100 
		* A monopoly firm is the only seller of a good or service with no close substitutes.
		* The market in which the monopoly firm operates is called a monopoly market.
		* Key concept: substitutability
		* Substitute truly a substitute? Included it in the market?
		* Different tastes and characteristics ==> different opinions about what is, and what is not, 
		 a “close” substitute ==> " ... will accept no substitutes!"
		 
		* A natural monopoly exists when, due to economies of scale, one firm can produce at a 
		lower cost per unit than can two or more firms (w/o intervention)
		* Small local monopolies ==> "... the only store in town" 
		* Large non-local monopolies 
			Control of supply ==> Al bauxite
			Govt sponsored (postal service)
		* Long-run profits 
	
		
	Imperfect Competition / Partial Monopoly <== 0 < x < 100
	(Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly)
		* market structures somewhere between perfect competition and monopoly
		* may be more than one seller, but too few to create a truly competitive market 
		* may be differentiated products (cars, restaurants, etc); but not standardized products (Prozac)
		* may be free entry and exit or barriers
		* may be strategic interdependence; not independence
		
	
NB
Market classification is a function of the number of buyers/sellers at temporal scale and spatial scale
(movies in your neighborhood; movies in CDMX; movies in the world))
(movies in 1960; movies in 1990; movies in 2025)

NB
In perfect competition, economic profit is relentlessly reduced to zero by the entry of other firms; 
in monopoly, economic profit can continue indefinitely.
