-- HW_01
Select one (1) discipline from the field of applied economics and one (1) discipline from the field of applied investing. You will become an expert in these disciplines and will share your knowledge with the class. To begin your path to expertise, you will write, and then translate, a two-page paper on the history of each discipline. The first page of each paper will be dedicated to the general history the discipline. The second page of each paper will be dedicated to the history of the discipline in Mexico. 

For this assignment and for all subsequent assignments in this class, the following format requirements apply:

	* Papers must be double-spaced, have 0.5 inch margins and 12-point Times New Roman font
	* In the upper right-hand corner please place your name, the course ID (followed by my last name in parentheses), 
	the assignment ID, and the date, That is, your upper right-hand corner should look like this.

                         <Your Name>
                         IT0524 (Marron)
						 <Assignment ID>
                         Date

	* The title of your paper should be centered in bold.
	* Unless told otherwise, you must include references in a standard format (eg, APA)
	* The assignment must be printed for submission although students should save a copy in PDF format.

For this assignment You should plan on 3 to 4 paragraphs per page for a total word count of not less than 750 words. You should provide at least three (3) references. Remember, your deliverable will be the original paper, written in either English or Spanish, and the translated paper, written in either Spanish or English. Be prepared to present and share your findings with the class. Please note that 'presenting and sharing your findings with the class' implies a somewhat informal presentation. I would expect about a 10 min overview of your findings with a focus on Mexico.
