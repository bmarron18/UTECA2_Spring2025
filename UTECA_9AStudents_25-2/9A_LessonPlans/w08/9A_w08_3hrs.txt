HW_06.1 [Due: 12 Mar 2025]

--- Task 1
Explain in detail Kosler and Armstrong's Integrated Marketing Communications model in Figure 14.1 (p. 429).


--- Task 2
Artusi (Artusi_Designing-New-Languages-for-Old-Products.pdf) has investigated how product language can be redesigned for established products. This means creating new meanings for such products. Look at Figure 2 (p. 6) and at Figure 3 (p. 10). Notice Artusi has distilled various statements (First-Order Categories) into a framework for redesigning product language (Second-Order Themes and Aggregated Dimensions). We will use this framework to help define the Message Strategy and the Creative Concepts for your marketing campaign.

Reproduce TABLE 2 (Design principles, selected quotes), and TABLE 3 (Product language, selected quotes) but REPLACE the quotes/statements with your own. That is, use the tables to define statements within the "Selected evidence of first-order categories" column that relate to your specific product/service. This process will provide the foundation for "redesigning" the language for your by product/service.


--- Task 3
Briefly explain Artusi's process of redesigning product language for established products as shown in Figure 3 (p.6)

5 insightful quotes on the psychology behind consumer decision-making


2. On anticipation:
“We perform an action in anticipation of its consequence. By this we try to predict how our future self feels. It helps in decision-making and activates the reward system.” 
		- Shagoon Maurya, psychotherapist and found of ursafespace

Takeaway: When you spark anticipation in your customers, you fuel action — action that can directly correlate to increased purchases and customer engagement. According to Maurya, when consumers look to satisfy their anticipation during the customer journey, they will also think about how a product or service will help them do that.

	Artusi_Designing-New-Languages-for-Old-Products.pdf

Artusi
	How product language can be redesigned in established products according to new meanings conceived for such 
	products. How do companies design new product languages for established products?
	
	We offer suggestions about how to manage the transition from abstract intended meanings to practical
	product language design.
	
	Design 
		the set of activities that purposively gives meaning to something. Design creates signs/signals that are 
		interpreted by a user (Fig 1 p. 3)
		
		the set of activities that shape product language in such a way that users are more likely to interpret
		a desired meaning


	Basic Design tools
		Forms, colors, shapes
		
	New product language depends on design (i.e., the construction of a system of signs) at the product level. Such a 
	system defines how the product speaks and how it intends to convey utilitarian, aesthetic and symbolic meanings 
	associated with the product.
