5 insightful quotes on the psychology behind consumer decision-making


3. On simplicity:
“With choice overload, the brain becomes cognitively burdened, and consumers engage in avoidance responses. They may just walk away rather than exert the effort needed to try to make the best choice for them. They may also end up being less satisfied with the choice they make because they continue to think about all the choices they gave up." 
		--- Colleen Kirk, Assoc Prof of Management and Marketing Studies, New York Institute of Technology

Takeaway: Humans need simplicity, and this translates to their experiences as consumers. It makes for a fulfilling, easy-to-understand shopping process. It also helps to bring them back for future experiences.
