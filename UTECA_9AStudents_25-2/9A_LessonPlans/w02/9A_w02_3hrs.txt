Highlights HW_01.2 (Konrod)
Language (European) 
	composed of sounds, which combine into words, which combine into sentences, which combine 
	into text (discourse). Discourse is anything longer than one sentence.

Phonetics 
	Relates to the study and classification of the sounds of speech. Unlike other sounds, speech 
	sounds (also called phonemes), are produced within the oral cavity with the intention to 
	construct a sign (e.g., a word) that conveys meaning. 
	
Phonemes
	the smallest unit of linguistic analysis, which are usually combined into words.
	
Meanings can change with sound
	The voicing, the place of articulation, the order and the stress on certain sounds can 
	change the meaning of a word. (eg desert , permit)
	
Morphology
	the study of the way phonemes can be combined into words using rules and exceptions.

Semantics
	the study of meaning in words
	
Synonyms
	different words that refer to the same (or almost the same) meaning.
	
Polysemy
	when the same word has several meanings
	
Grammatical and syntax 
	Rules relate to the way embedding different word forms in a particular order in a sentence 
	produces meaning. ==> “Let’s eat, grandma!” vs. “Let’s eat grandma!”
	
Word order
	usually important for meaning but some languages flexible ==> ¨the purple lamp fell off the 
	yellow table’ will" (English) == ‘off the table yellow the lamp fell purple’ (Russian).

NB. Most important!! 
	know how the text flows. fundamentally, how sounds and meanings flow

Advertising genre
	a form of mass communication with the purpose of persuading a large audience to do something (usually to consider an offering). This purpose dictates the use of specific linguistic aspects such as exaggeration (puffery), figurative language and other rhetorical devices.

Highlights HW_01.1 (Ellis)
	1.4 Marketing, Efficiency and Utility Creation

Marketing
	performs a useful and valuable role in helping to distribute goods and services, and in so doing, enhancing the quality of life
	
Is advertising useful to the consumer, by aiding them in making more effective decisions?

Marketing as ‘applied economics’
	use economic theory to improve marketing practice AND using the knowledge gained from studying the market to critically examine economic theory especially consumer utility
	



General Economic Concepts and Terms

Axiom 1: As a society, our resources—land, labor, and capital—are insufficient to produce all the goods and services we might desire. In other words, society faces a scarcity of resources.

	Theorem 1: Only in rare circumstance can we (individually) produce all of the goods and 
	services  we need. We are economically linked to others in hundreds—even thousands—of 
	different ways.
	
	Theorem 2: All (functional) economies exhibit high degrees of specialization and exchange 
	because specialization and exchange enable us to enjoy greater production, and higher living 
	standards than would otherwise be possible.


Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must 
shift resources away from producing something else. “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”
		
	Theorem 1. In a market system, individuals are not simply free to do what they want. Rather, 
	they are constrained by the resources they control.
	
		Corrollary 1: We do not all start in the same place in the economic race. Individuals 
		may have more or less resources under their control than others.
