5 insightful quotes on the psychology behind consumer decision-making


5. On relevancy:

“How relevant is a brand to one’s life, routine, existence? If a brand can market relevancy, that brand can then allow marketers to do the things they do best to keep that brand connection and start building brand loyalty." 
		--- Carl Turner, CEO and founder, SWIPEBY

Takeaway: Distracted consumers are a byproduct of irrelevancy. They don’t pay attention to a product or service because they can’t tangibly see how it could positively affect them. In order to solve this problem, you must establish a connection between your brand and the customer. Show them why your brand is worthy of their attention by clearly communicating the relevancy of your offering.
