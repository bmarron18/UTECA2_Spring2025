Designing a marketing campaign for either a product or a service is a multi-step process. Begin the process by identifying and describing the product/service, and by using the Reporter's Toolkit to define the fundamental properties of advertisement(s) for your marketing campaign. In a one-page+ paper, i) sketch the nature of your product/service (be as specifc as possible); and ii) provide answers to the Reporter's Toolkit questions for the advertisement(s) that you envision for your product/service. Recall that the Reporter's Toolkit includes the following,

	1. Who's the target audience?
	2. What's the feel?
	3. What's the hook?
	4. When should I buy?
	5. Where is the product/service available?

5 insightful quotes on the psychology behind consumer decision-making


1. On emotional connectivity:

“There is no decision without emotion, [shopping] is always emotional whether a brand tells you it is or whether 
it’s the purchaser creating a want or desire ... You can’t sell without it — emotion is a currency all in itself.” 
	-- Bernadette Butler, CEO & Co-founder, Storytap

Takeaway: Emotions drive purchase decisions. An internal motivator, your consumers’ feelings toward your product, 
service or brand are the deciding factor in whether or not that conversion will happen.

Review from last time----
Kosler&Armstrong_Principles-of-Marketing Figure 14.1 (p. 429) Integrated Marketing Communications




And now, launching your campaign
	building the message....



---- Kosler&Armstrong_Principles-of-Marketing	---------------


Developing Advertising Strategy (p. 457)
	two major elements: 
		1. creating advertising messages
		2. selecting advertising media.

	Today...soaring media costs, more-focused target marketing strategies, and
	the blizzard of new online, mobile, and social media have promoted the importance of the
	media-planning function. The decision about which media to use for an ad campaign—
	television, newspapers, magazines, video, a website, social media, mobile devices, or
	email—is now sometimes more critical than the creative elements of the campaign.


Creating the Advertising Message and Brand Content (p. 457)
	Look at the Stats!!!! (bottom p. 457)

	Advertisers can no longer force-feed the same old cookie-cutter
	messages and content to captive consumers through traditional media.
	Simply interrupting or disrupting consumers no longer works. Unless ads
	provide content that is engaging, useful, or entertaining, many consumers
	will simply ignore or skip them.
	
	
	Merging of advertising and entertainment takes one of two forms: 
		1. advertainment or brand integrations. The aim of advertainment is to make ads and brand content
		themselves so entertaining or so useful that people want to watch them.
		
		2. making the brand an inseparable part of some other form of entertainment or content. The most common form of 
		brand integration is product placements—embedding brands as props within other programming.




Message and Content Strategy. (p 460)
	Message Strategy ==> Creative Concept ==> Execution Style
	
	Message strategy 
		statements are plain, straightforward outlines of benefits and positioning points that the advertiser wants 
		to stress. 
		
	Creative Concept
		Bring the message strategy to life in a distinctive and memorable way.
		Simple message ideas may become great ad campaigns.
		Choice of specific appeals to be used
			Meaningful
			Believable
			Distinctive

	Execution Style
		See list p. 461
