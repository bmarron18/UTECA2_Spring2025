HW_05.1 [Due: 05 Mar 2025]
Designing a marketing campaign for either a product or a service is a multi-step process. Begin the process by identifying and describing the product/service, and by using the Reporter's Toolkit to define the fundamental properties of advertisement(s) for your marketing campaign. In a one-page+ paper, i) sketch the nature of your product/service (be as specifc as possible); and ii) provide answers to the Reporter's Toolkit questions for the advertisement(s) that you envision for your product/service. Recall that the Reporter's Toolkit includes the following,

	1. Who's the target audience?
	2. What's the feel?
	3. What's the hook?
	4. When should I buy?
	5. Where is the product/service available?
	6. Why should I buy the product/service?
