		==> the construction of a system of signs at the product level that can be 
			interpreted by people (Fig 1 p. 3)
		==> the shape of product language such that people are likely to interpret a desired meaning
		==> a system that defines how the product speaks and how it conveys utilitarian, aesthetic 
		and symbolic meaning
		
	Design tools
