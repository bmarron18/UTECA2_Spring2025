5 insightful quotes on the psychology behind consumer decision-making


4. On cultural values:

“Every buying decision, every piece of persuasion has to fit within the cultural values [of your target audience]. People don’t relate to the mass market, they relate to class and community and 'who’s most important in my reference group?' and that’s where you see issues in marketing; if you have this new innovative topic but people can’t understand what it is or what it’s supposed to do for them [you won’t see repeat purchases or truly influence consumers].” 
		--- Margaret J. King, Ph.D., Director of The Center for Cultural Studies & Analysis

Takeaway: Human culture is a psychological response to life and has a major influence on the actions taken by consumers. Purchase decisions, services rendered and brand support can all be tied back to culture (socioeconomic statuses, geographic locations, aspirations, etc.). Marketing efforts must leverage cultural aspects and clearly communicate to consumers the purpose products and services will have in their lives.

---- ROI Calcs
Algorithm for ROI Calculation

ROI is calculated using the formula:
	ROI=(Net Profit)/(Initial Investment)×100

Where:
    Net Profit = Final Value of Investment – Initial Investment
    Initial Investment = The amount originally invested

Step-by-Step Algorithm
    Input the Initial Investment (I).
    Input the Final Value of Investment (F).
    Compute Net Profit = F−IF−I.
    Compute ROI = (Net ProfitI)×100(INet Profit​)×100.
    Output ROI as a percentage.

   

Example Calculation

Given:
    Initial Investment = $10,000
    Final Value of Investment = $12,500

    Net Profit = $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500
    ROI = (2,50010,000)×100(10,0002,500​)×100 = 25%



---Python Code Implementation

def calculate_roi(initial_investment, final_value):
    if initial_investment == 0:
        return "Initial investment cannot be zero"
    
    net_profit = final_value - initial_investment
    roi = (net_profit / initial_investment) * 100
    return f"ROI: {roi:.2f}%"

# Example Usage
initial = 10000
final = 12500
print(calculate_roi(initial, final))
