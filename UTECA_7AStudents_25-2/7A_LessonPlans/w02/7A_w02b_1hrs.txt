HW_02.1		Due: 28Jan2025
Read Grossfield's, "Language and the Law." Write a one-page summary of the paper in English and translate the summary into Spanish. Standard format requirements apply.

HW_02.2		[Due: 29Jan2025]
The legal systems of Mexico and of the US are fundamentally different because of their history. That is, Mexico's legal system is structured around civil law, while the US legal system is structured around common law. Explore these differences in a two-page paper. 

As a first step in your investigation, check out the following links to Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute:
