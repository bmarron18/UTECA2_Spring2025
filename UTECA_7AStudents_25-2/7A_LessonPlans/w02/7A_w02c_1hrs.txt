Read Grossfield's, "Language and the Law." Write a one-page summary of the paper in English and translate the summary into Spanish. Standard format requirements apply.

HW_02.2		Due: 29Jan2025
The legal systems of Mexico and of the US are fundamentally different because of their history. That is, Mexico's legal system is structured around civil law, while the US legal system is structured around common law. Explore these differences in a two-page paper. As a first step in your investigation, check out the following links to Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute:

	legal systems
	https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_systems

	civil law (Mexico via Spain and France)
	https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_law

	common law (US via England)
	https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/common_law

The final deliverable will include the original paper (two pages) and its translation. Note that the standard format applies and that references must be included.
