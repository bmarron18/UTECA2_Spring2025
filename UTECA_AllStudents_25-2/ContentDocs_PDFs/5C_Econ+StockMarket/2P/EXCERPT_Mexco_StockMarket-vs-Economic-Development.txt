Abstract
We evaluate the association between stock market development and
the aggregate economy for the long-run and the short-run. We perform
cointegration and common cycle tests considering various stock market
indicators, real GDP and industrial production for the Mexican economy.
While controlling for structural breaks in the series, we identify the existence
of common trends but not common cycles. Specifically, stock market activity
and real variables exhibit a positive and significant relationship in the
long-run; however, they appear to have different responses to transitory
shocks. These results confirm that stock market development is conducive
to economic growth.
