World stock markets are booming. Developing country stock markets compose a
disproportionately large amount of this growth. Over the past 10 years, world stock market
capitalization rose from $4.7 trillion to $15.2 trillion, and emerging market capitalization jumped
from less than 4 percent to almost 13 percent of total world capitalization. Similarly, over this
decade, the trading of shares on emerging stock exchanges rose from less than 3 percent to 17
percent of the total value of transactions on the world's stock exchanges. Further, Korajczyk
(1996) shows that emerging markets have become more integrated with world capital markets
during the past seven years. The blossoming of emerging stock markets has attracted the
attention of international investors. Portfolio equity flows to emerging markets jumped from
$150 million in 1984 to over $39 billion in 1995. Yet, there exists very little empirical evidence
on the relationship between stock market development and long-run economic growth.

To assess whether stock markets are merely burgeoning casinos where more and more
players are coming to place bets or whether stock markets are importantly linked to economic
growth, this paper reviews a diffuse theoretical literature and presents new empirical evidence. In
terms of theory, a growing literature argues that stock markets provide services that boost
economic growth. Specifically, Greenwood and Smith (1996) show that large stock markets can
lower the cost of mobilizing savings and thereby facilitate investment in the most productive
technologies. Bencivenga, Smith, and Starr (1996) and Levine (1991) argue that stock market
liquidity -- the ability to trade equity easily -- is important for growth. Specifically, although many
profitable investments require a long-run commitment of capital, savers do not like to relinquish
control of their savings for long periods. Liquid equity markets ease this tension by providing an
asset to savers that they can quickly and inexpensively sell. Simultaneously, firms have permanent
access to capital raised through equity issues. Moreover, Kyle (1984) and Holmstrom and Tirole
(1995) argue that liquid stock markets can increase incentives to get information about firms and
improve corporate governance. Finally, Obstfeld (1994) shows that international risk sharing
through internationally integrated stock markets improves resource allocation and can accelerate
the rate of economic growth.

Theoretical disagreement exists, however, about the importance of stock markets for
economic growth. Mayer (1988) argues that even large stock markets are unimportant sources of
corporate finance. Stiglitz (1985, 1993) says that stock market liquidity will not enhance
incentives for acquiring information about firms or exerting corporate governance. Moreover,
Devereux and Smith (1994) emphasize that greater risk sharing through internationally integrated
stock markets can actually reduce saving rates and slow economic growth. Finally, Shleifer and
Summers' (1988) and Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny's (1990a,b) analyses suggest that stock market
development can hurt economic growth by easing counterproductive corporate takeovers.

Considering the conflicting theoretical perspectives on the importance of well-functioning
stock markets for economic growth, this paper uses cross-country regressions to examine the
association between stock market development and economic growth. To conduct this
investigation, we need measures of stock market development. Theory, however, does not
provide a unique concept or measure of stock market development. Theory suggests that stock
market size, liquidity, and integration with world capital markets may affect economic growth.
Consequently, this paper uses a conglomerate index of overall stock market development
constructed by Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (1996). This index combines information on stock
market size, liquidity, and international integration to produce an overall measure of stock market
development.

More specifically, we use pooled cross-country, time-series regressions to evaluate the
relationship between stock market development and economic growth. Using data on 41
countries over the period 1976-1993, we split the sample period, so that each country has two
observations (data permitting) with data averaged over each sub-period. In the tradition of recent
work [Barro (1991)], we regress the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita on
a variety of variables designed to control for initial conditions, political stability, investment in
human capital, and macroeconomic conditions. We then include the conglomerate index of stock
market development. Thus, we evaluate whether there is a relationship between economic growth
and stock market development that is independent of other variables associated with economic
growth.

This paper builds on Atje and Jovanovic's (1993) study of stock market trading and
economic growth in two ways. We use conglomerate indexes of stock market development that
combine information on stock market size, trading, and integration. Second, we control for initial
conditions and other factors that may affect economic growth in light of evidence that many
cross-country regression results are fragile to changes in the conditioning information set [Levine
and Renelt (1992)]. Thus, we gauge the robustness of the relationship between overall stock
market development and economic growth to changes in the conditioning information set.

We find a strong correlation between overall stock market development and long-run
economic growth. After controlling for the initial level of GDP per capita, initial investment in
human capital, political stability, and measures monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policy, stock
market development remains positively and significantly correlated with long-run economic
growth. The results are consistent with theories that imply a positive relationship between stock
market development and long-run economic growth. The results are inconsistent with theories
that predict no correlation or a negative association between stock market development and
economic performance.

This paper empirically evaluated the relationship between stock market development and
long-run growth. The data suggest that stock market development is positively associated with
economic growth. Moreover, the instrumental variables procedures indicate a strong connection
between the predetermined component of stock market development and long-run economic
growth. While these cross-country growth regressions imply a strong link between stock market
development and economic growth, the results should be viewed as suggestive partial correlations
that stimulate additional research rather than as conclusive findings.

Much work remains to better understand the relationship between stock market
development and economic growth. Specifically, careful case studies might better identify the
causal interactions between stock market development and economic growth. Similarly, this
paper examined the cross-sectional relationship between stock market development and growth.
Future research could also exploit the time-series properties of the relationship. Finally, this paper
says nothing about policy. While stock market development is strongly correlated with long-run
economic growth, future research needs to identify the policies that will ease sound securities
market development.
