Abstract:
It is important to understand the interplay between stock market and real economy to figure out
the various channels through which financial markets drive economic growth. In the current
study we investigate this relationship for Chinese economy, the fastest growing and largest
emerging economy in the world. Using the methodology of unit root testing in the presence of
structural breaks and using an ARDL model, we find that Global Financial Crises had a
significant impact on both China’s real sector and financial sector. Our findings also suggest
that Shanghai A share market has a long run negative association with the real sector of the
economy, however the magnitude of impact is tiny and can be ignored. We conjecture that this
negative relationship is the proof of so called existence of irrational prosperity on the stock
market and the bubbles in China’s financial sector. We do not find any evidence of a
relationship between stock market and real economy in the short run. Toda Yamamoto
causality test supports the demand-driven hypothesis that economic growth spurs development
of stock markets for China’s B share market.
