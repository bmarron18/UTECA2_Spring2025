2.0	SOP PROCESS

2.1	SOP Preparation
The organization should have a procedure in place for determining what procedures or
processes need to be documented. Those SOPs should then be written by individuals
knowledgeable with the activity and the organization's internal structure. These individuals are
essentially subject-matter experts who actually perform the work or use the process. A team
approach can be followed, especially for multi-tasked processes where the experiences of a
number of individuals are critical, which also promotes “buy-in” from potential users of the SOP.

SOPs should be written with sufficient detail so that someone with limited experience
with or knowledge of the procedure, but with a basic understanding, can successfully reproduce
the procedure when unsupervised. The experience requirement for performing an activity should
be noted in the section on personnel qualifications. For example, if a basic chemistry or
biological course experience or additional training is required that requirement should be
indicated.

2.2 SOP Review and Approval
SOPs should be reviewed (that is, validated) by one or more individuals with appropriate
training and experience with the process. It is especially helpful if draft SOPs are actually tested
by individuals other than the original writer before the SOPs are finalized.

The finalized SOPs should be approved as described in the organization’s Quality
Management Plan or its own SOP for preparation of SOPs. Generally the immediate supervisor,
such as a section or branch chief, and the organization’s quality assurance officer review and
approve each SOP. Signature approval indicates that an SOP has been both reviewed and
approved by management. As per the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998, use of
electronic signatures, as well as electronic maintenance and submission, is an acceptable
substitution for paper, when practical.

2.3 Frequency of Revisions and Reviews
SOPs need to remain current to be useful. Therefore, whenever procedures are changed,
SOPs should be updated and re-approved. If desired, modify only the pertinent section of an
SOP and indicate the change date/revision number for that section in the Table of Contents and
the document control notation.

SOPs should be also systematically reviewed on a periodic basis, e.g. every 1-2 years, to
ensure that the policies and procedures remain current and appropriate, or to determine whether
the SOPs are even needed. The review date should be added to each SOP that has been
reviewed. If an SOP describes a process that is no longer followed, it should be withdrawn from
the current file and archived.

The review process should not be overly cumbersome to encourage timely review. The
frequency of review should be indicated by management in the organization’s Quality Management Plan. That plan should also indicate the individual(s) responsible for ensuring that SOPs are current.

2.4 Checklists
Many activities use checklists to ensure that steps are followed in order. Checklists are
also used to document completed actions. Any checklists or forms included as part of an activity
should be referenced at the points in the procedure where they are to be used and then attached to
the SOP.

In some cases, detailed checklists are prepared specifically for a given activity. In those
cases, the SOP should describe, at least generally, how the checklist is to be prepared, or on what
it is to be based. Copies of specific checklists should be then maintained in the file with the
activity results and/or with the SOP.

Remember that the checklist is not the SOP, but a part of the SOP.

2.5 Document Control
Each organization should develop a numbering system to systematically identify and
label their SOPs, and the document control should be described in its Quality Management Plan.
Generally, each page of an SOP should have control documentation notation, similar to that
illustrated below. A short title and identification (ID) number can serve as a reference
designation. The revision number and date are very useful in identifying the SOP in use when
reviewing historical data and is critical when the need for evidentiary records is involved and
when the activity is being reviewed. When the number of pages is indicated, the user can
quickly check if the SOP is complete. Generally this type of document control notation is
located in the upper right-hand corner of each document page following the title page.

													Short Title/ID #
													Rev. #:
													Date:
													Page 1 of


2.6 SOP Document Tracking and Archival
The organization should maintain a master list of all SOPs. This file or database should
indicate the SOP number, version number, date of issuance, title, author, status, organizational
division, branch, section, and any historical information regarding past versions. The QA
Manager (or designee) is generally the individual responsible for maintaining a file listing all
current quality-related SOPs used within the organization. If an electronic database is used,
automatic “Review SOP” notices can be sent. Note that this list may be used also when audits
are being considered or when questions are raised as to practices being followed within the organization.


As noted above in Section 2.3, the Quality Management Plan should indicate the
individual(s) responsible for assuring that only the current version is used. That plan should also
designated where, and how, outdated versions are to be maintained or archived in a manner to
prevent their continued use, as well as to be available for historical data review.

Electronic storage and retrieval mechanisms are usually easier to access than a hard-copy
document format. For the user, electronic access can be limited to a read-only format, thereby
protecting against unauthorized changes made to the document.
