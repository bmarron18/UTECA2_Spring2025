Note: For ease of computation and understanding, it is assumed that the accuracy for each component of a vector
baseline measurement is equal to the linear accuracy standard for a single-dimensional measurement at the 95%
confidence level. Thus, the linear one-standard deviation(s) is computed by:
s = + / = <e + (0.1dxp) 2 > / 1.96
where d is the length of the baseline in kilometers.

HYDROLOGICAL ANALYSES
A.Perform hydrologic analyses prior to design of drainage within LANL boundaries. Use
appropriate industry standard methodologies such as the Rational Method, Technical
Release 55, SWMM, and HEC methodology to compute peak flows from drainage areas
and for sizing drainage structures. Unless conditions or requirements dictate, the
recommendation is to use a 25-year-return storm. Refer to methodologies outlined within
the USDA National Resources Conservation Service: National Engineering Handbook,
Part 630, Hydrology in hydrologic analyses for large off-site drainage areas. Guidance:
Refer to Volume 1-Hydrology 1995 of the New Mexico State Highway Department New
Mexico Drainage Design Bureau and U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service
publication Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, TR 55 for further guidance.
B.Sites disturbing greater than 5,000 square feet are subject to Section 438 of the Federal
Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 which establishes strict storm water
runoff requirements for federal facility development and redevelopment projects. The
Section reads, “The sponsor of any development or redevelopment project involving a
Federal facility with a footprint that exceeds 5,000 square feet shall use site planning,
design, construction, and maintenance strategies for the property to maintain or restore, to
the maximum extent technically feasible, the predevelopment hydrology of the property
with regard to the temperature, rate, volume, and duration of flow.”
Implementation of Section 438 must be achieved through the use of green
infrastructure/low impact development (GI/LID) methods that use or mimic natural
processes to: 1) infiltrate and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near to where it falls to earth. Examples of appropriate GI/LID are:
•green roofs
•trees and tree boxes
•rain gardens
•vegetated swales
•pocket wetlands
•infiltration planters
•porous and permeable pavements
•vegetated strips
•reforestation and revegetation
•protection of riparian buffers and floodplains
•rain barrels and cisterns
GI/LID features must be sized and constructed to release stormwater runoff at rates and
volumes no greater than predevelopment. Pre and post-development runoff hydrology
shall be calculated based on a 1.14 inch event (2 year/ 24 hour design storm). A
different precipitation depth based on available site specific rain gage data may be used if
prior approval is obtained from ENV-CP and U&IF. Project designs and hydrologic
calculations must be reviewed and approved by an ENV-CP. Construction specifications
are published in the LANL Storm Water BMP Manual.
Guidance:
1.Site-specific soil properties, such as infiltration rate, may be required for larger
projects. Contact Environmental Compliance Programs (ENV-CP) for guidance.
2.Projects with limited space, poor soil infiltration rates, or other technical
constraints may be able to document Technical Infeasibility and manage runoff
to the maximum extent technically feasible.
C.In accordance with DOE Standard 1020, the potential for flooding shall be considered for
LANL sites that are located in defined flood plains. Utilize available information for the
evaluation of local flooding potential and surface drainage analysis. For design of
facilities subject to flood plain hydrology, use DOE-STD-1020 guidance of a 25-year, 6-
hour rainfall event (latest edition) for minimum design of surface drainage or water
collection management systems.
D.For the Rational Method, use the Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Relationship Curve (Figure
G20GEN-1), and the C-factors in Table G20GEN-1.
E.Submit hydrologic analyses to the LANL Subcontract Technical Representative (STR)
for coordination with ENV-CP and Utilities and Institutional Facilities (U&IF) and the
approved analysis to the project file. Drainage submittals should include the following:
1.
2.
3.
Drainage area map showing the location of the site in relation to well-known
landmarks.
Description of existing and proposed structures, which will influence site
drainage.
Hydrologic calculations, including a runoff tabling sheet.

concrete may be required for traffic control purposes. See Master Spec Section 03 3053,
Miscellaneous Cast-in-Place Concrete.
ROADWAYS
ROAD DESIGN
A.The fundamental approach to road design is to first identify the design speed the road is
to accommodate, the nominal vehicle type that governs the design, and the road
classification such as arterial, collector, etc. Design is then accomplished by selection of
appropriate characteristics to accommodate the design vehicle at the design speed in a
safe and efficient manner at reasonable cost on a durable road. The LANL Traffic
Engineer will determine road classification, design speed, and design vehicles for all
projects and establish posted legal speeds after appropriate examination of the completed
road.

IntroductionPrinciplesReferences
Architectural design guidelines can promote a
greater sense of architectural cohesiveness,
permanence and visual quality at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.The following principles are the foundation for
the architectural design guidelines:Other Laboratory and industry documents to be
referenced are as follows:
Building design should reflect the science
and technology environment of the
Laboratory while relating to the climate and
aesthetics of the Southwest and New
Mexico.LEM

Buildings should incorporate energy and
resources conservation materials and
systems.
Architectural design controls should be used
to promote visual clarity and cohesiveness
within each planning area.
Building design should incorporate low-
maintenance, fire-resistant materials.
Buildings should be designed to have flexible

UNIFYING ARCHITECTURAL
DESIGNS
Unifying design establishes architectural
cohesiveness within each planning area as well
as within the overall facility. A specific palette of
colors, materials, and forms will visually link the
areas and an identified unifying element will act
as a visual connector to link other design
components within the Laboratory.
1. Architectural Color Palettes
Specific color and material palettes have been
established for the following planning areas:
 Core area
 LANSCE
 Pajarito Corridor West
 Pajarito Corridor East
 Anchor Ranch
Each planning areas palette is unique but also
relates to an overall palette for the Laboratory.
The color and design specifics for each of the
above planning areas follows the architectural
guidelines in Section V-D-1 and 2.
2. Unifying Elements
A metallic material used as an accent should be
incorporated into all new or renovated buildings
and facilities. The metallic accent should
complement the Laboratorys proposed way-
finding system as well as the exterior lighting
fixtures, functional architectural elements, or
primary entry design. Feature elements should
be visible from the primary entry.

BUILDING MASSING
1. Building Design
The Laboratory can promote a cohesive
environment through a distinct vocabulary of
architectural forms based on a visual inventory
of existing buildings. The intent is to highlight the
Laboratorys science and technology mission
while acknowledging indigenous regional
architecture.
The Laboratorys architecture is defined by:
 Building design
 Building form
 Roofs
 Building entries
Image V-1: Building Design Example
a. Architecture
An architectural style direction has been
identified for use at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. The Laboratorys architectural
guidelines for newer renovated structures
includes:
 Use strong forms that characterize the
Southwest imagery such as circles, arcs and
stepped massing (Image V-1).
 Provide a predominance of wall mass over
window openings on appropriate solar
exposures (Image V-2 and V-3).
 On large wall areas, use warm colors in
various materials such as stucco, stone,
stone tiles, concrete and concrete block
(Image V-1).
 Use stronger accent colors from a
southwest palette on architectural elements
such as window frames, entry structures,
sunshades, accent wall segments and accent
roof elements.
 Combine durable natural materials such as
stone with industrialized materials such as
steel, glass and aluminum.
Image V-2: Building Design Example
Image V-3: Building Design Example
b. Fire-Resistant Design
All new structures should follow Laboratory and
reference guidelines for fire-resistant building
design. Existing buildings should incorporate
these design measures when upgraded and
renovated.
S I
Building Form
Building form is determined by various factors
including building size, building footprint, number
of stories, intended use, structural system and
limits established by adjacent spaces and
structures. The following sections identify
design guidelines based on building size,
composition, height and location. Mechanical
stacks or cooling towers are not considered a
building mass for purposes of assessing massing
requirements.
a. Building Massing
Building mass requirements should be based on
building square footage. See Table V-1 for
guidelines.
Additional building mass requirements include:
 Provide a break in plane for each change in
mass. Massing changes should have a five-
foot minimum offset horizontally and three-
foot minimum offset vertically (Figure V-2).
 Provide a change in mass and plane at all
primary entrance facades. Small structures
may achieve this with an entry element
projection or recess.
 Maintain an approximate 1/3 to 2/3
proportion mass between the primary
facade relative to the overall building length
(Figure V-3).
 Articulate secondary facades by means of
plane changes, material and color changes,
and window patterning.
 Step back buildings three stories and greater
a minimum of five ft. along 50% of the
building perimeter.

Figure V-2: Building Massing
b. Building Composition
Buildings should express a balanced composition
of massing, fenestration and detailing. The
horizontal direction should have a greater
percentage of mass or area than the vertical
direction to connect the building to the site. This
effect can be achieved through:
 A composition of building masses on a
multiple structure complex,
 A composition of openings (window and
door) on a single mass structure, or
 Any combination thereof.

Figure V-3: Primary Building Facade Massing
Unique elements such as triangular shed roofs
or vaulted roofs, as utilized on the Materials
Science Laboratory, add further interest and
impact to the overall building composition. See
Table V-4 for specific building form guidelines
for each planning area.
Building Height and Use
a. Roof Design and Climate
Requirements for building height are a function
of building use and location (see Table V-2).
All office, administrative, and light lab buildings
two stories or more in the core area maximize
the buildings use and adaptability while
minimizing site impact (Image V-5).
The following are guidelines for roof design in
response to the local climate:
 Design roofs to accommodate winter snow
loads and summer rains common to the
north central New Mexico climate.
 Detail roof edges to protect the structure
from moisture damage.
 Locate drainpipe outlets to manage rain and
snow melt runoff and avoid ice buildup
particularly on northern exposures.
 Incorporate a system of internal or external
downspouts and gutters, site drains and/or
swales to deliver water away from the
building.
d. Relationship Between Old and New
Structures
Design new structures within a building complex
to relate to adjacent structures as much as is
practical through integration of similar forms,
massing, materials, details and colors. Colors
and materials should comply with those
approved for the specific planning area.
Image V-6: Building Height Requirements
b. Roof Forms, Colors and Materials
Acceptable roof forms include flat, pitched
(shed, gable) and vaulted (bow). For added
interest on administrative, office and light lab
buildings, pitched or vaulted roof forms may be
combined with parapeted roof forms on a single
building (e.g., shed and parapeted or vaulted and
parapeted). Roof monitors and clerestories are
encouraged as a means to admit daylight and
solar heat gain.
e. Adaptive Reuse
Design all new office and laboratory buildings
for changes of use or user. Design interior
spaces for greater space planning flexibility and
adaptability by limiting or strategically organizing
interior structural elements.

rating, are low-maintenance and have long-term
durability. The following table (Table V-3)
identifies acceptable roof forms, materials, pitch,
light reflectance value (LRV) and color ranges.
For a listing of metal roof colors and roof forms
identified for use within each planning area, see
Table V-4
Building Entries
Guidelines for primary and secondary building
entries are:
 Clearly define building entrances as viewed
from primary access points (streets,
walkways, parking areas). The entrance can
become more visually prominent by
constructing it as a separate, distinctive
mass attached to the building or as a large,
recessed opening within the buildings
overall mass. The use of entrance courts,
awnings, canopies, trellises and special
accent materials or colors can also highlight
building entrances.
 Incorporate materials such as stone or
highly finished metals into primary entrance
designs to add interest and importance.
 Design all entrances at a human scale
through the use of easily recognizable
elements such as standard heights of doors,
railings, stairs, seating and window mullions.
 Provide weather protection for all seasons
at primary entries with a covered area
projecting or recessed a minimum of eight
ft.
 Identify secondary entries similar to primary
entries but with fewer and smaller accents.
Façade articulation (visual changes along a
building) adds interest to a structures
appearance. Façade articulation can reduce the
scale and mass of a large structure. Fenestration
can add depth, rhythm, shade and shadow to the
building façade.
Methods of articulating buildings covered in the
Design Principles include:
 Facade articulation
 Fenestration
 Building skin materials
 Colors and materials
1. Facade Articulation2. Fenestration
Façade articulation can reduce the scale and
mass of a large structure. Various fenestrations
can be used to add depth, rhythm, shade and
shadow to the building façade (Image V-13).a. Size, Shape, Pattern, Type & Scale

The following are façade articulation techniques:
 Window fenestration and multiple wall
surface materials
 Score lines on stucco or concrete walls
 Banding of different colors or materials
 Attached or free-standing shading devices
on south or west exposures

Image V-14: Horizontal/Vertical Balance
Horizontal/Vertical Balance - Most
Laboratory office, administrative, or light lab
structures have predominately horizontal
forms. For vertical balance to these
structures, individual window sizes should be
square or preferably more vertical than
horizontal (Image V-17).
Window Groupings - Multiple window
groupings are expected and acceptable but
are most effective when the groups are
more vertical than horizontal (Image V15-18).
Reveals Around Windows - Windows that
are set in from the building façade are
preferred over multiple window groupings or
openings to emphasize a buildings mass.
Reveals should be recessed a minimum of six
inches to add depth and shadow (Image V-16).
Tall Buildings - Buildings three stories or
more should have windows with reveals.
Scale - Use mullions and smaller-paned
glazing to add human scale to the
fenestration.
