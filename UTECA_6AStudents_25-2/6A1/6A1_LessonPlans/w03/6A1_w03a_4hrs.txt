HW_03.1		[Due: 4 Feb 2025]
In a one-page+ paper (in both English and Spanish) compare and contrast Kuhn's concept of normal science, and the public's perception of linear science and engineering, with wicked problems. The standard format applies.

Review
	IV. Normal Science as Puzzle-solving
	
	To scientists, at least, the results gained in normal research are significant because they 
	add to the scope and precision with which the paradigm can be applied.
	
	Bringing a normal research problem to a conclusion is achieving the anticipated in a new 
	way, and it requires the solution of all sorts of complex instrumental, conceptual, and 
	mathematical puzzles. The man who succeeds proves himself an expert puzzle-solver, and the 
	challenge of the puzzle is an important part of what usually drives him on.
	
	Nevertheless, the individual engaged on a normal research problem is almost never doing any 
	one of these things [open up new territory, display order, and test long-accepted belief.. 
	Once engaged, his motivation is of a rather different sort. What then challenges him is the 
	conviction that, if only he is skilful enough, he will succeed in solving a puzzle that no 
	one before has solved or solved so well.
	
	
	... one of the things a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for 
	choosing problems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed to have 
	solutions. To a great extent these are the only problems that the community will admit as 
	scientific or encourage its members to undertake.
	
	On the contrary, the really pressing problems, e.g., a cure for cancer or the design of a 
	lasting peace, are often not puzzles at all, largely because they may not have any solution.
	

And now...
