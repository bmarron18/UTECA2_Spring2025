“
…most…problems in organizations [and elsewhere] are
‘wicked problems,’…but most [problem solving] methods
are suitable for simple, well-structured problems.
The usual approaches do not, therefore, help organizations
[or people] deal with their most important problems.”

Creative Problem Solving
Robert Flood and M. Jackson (1991)
