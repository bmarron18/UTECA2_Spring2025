“Science can amuse and fascinate us all, but it is engineering that changes the world.”
	—Isaac Asimov, American writer, professor of biochemistry


---- Content

Socratic Seminar after silent reading
	Jeremy Ramsden, "The Differences Between Engineering and Science"


	General perception 	1)“industry, science and technology create jobs and create wealth”

						
	Three states 	1) academic science and scientists
						“knowledge obtained by observation, by experiment and by subsequent deduction 
						... the object of the scientist is the determination of general laws and the 
						deduction of principles from the effects which are observed”.	<== lacks of 
						empirical support "how improbable quantitative discovery by quantitative 
						measurement is.”
						
						independent mission to uncover hidden truths about nature and the scientists 
						are guided by their intuition about what is important to investigate, which 
						may only be slightly influenced by practical human needs
						
						the scientist has an easier task — he or she is only dealing with the absolute 
						arbiter of nature;All that is required of him is unimpeachable integrity,
						
					2) engineers 
						“the science of the industrial arts”, applies scientific principles and 
						imagination to the creation of useful products required by society.
						
						the engineer, when confronted by problems, for which existing knowledge is 
						inadequate, will not wait for the  scientist but will forge ahead, using 
						heuristic methods to establish a bridgehead in unknown territory, achieving 
						what the scientists may have deemed to be “impossible”
						
						the engineer himself expands knowledge as necessary when what he needs has not 
						been made available by the scientist
						
						there is a strong ethical, hence ultimately arbitrary, dimension to the work 
						of the engineer. For who is to decide what is vital or necessary in human 
						society? Is there really such a thing as a social consensus, vague and 
						impalpable perhaps, but which nevertheless results in a distinct dynamism in a 
						particular direction? Or is it a matter of unshakeable personal conviction?
						
						the engineer is forcing changes (“transforming the conditions of life”) that 
						cannot be absolutely justified in any way.
						
						the engineer has more in common with the lawyer than with the scientist: facts 
						and opinions must be marshalled in order to achieve a desired result; 
						engineering is definitely not just “applied science”


					3) innovation, “the development of new products, services and processes" (both 
					scientists and engineers)
						
						derived from ==> important problems that emerge from some kind of social 
						consensus (e.g., the United Nations “Millennium Goals”.
						
						social responsibility was strong in theminds of the early Victorian engineers 
						later became distorted ==> as early as  1886, “beneficial undertakings had 
						been proved profitable; [later] it was assumed that a business,  as long as it 
						is profitable, does not require to be proved beneficial”.
						
						profitability has become the sole criterion of vital necessity

Thoughts on Picon (Students)
I found these in Picon....................................
Facts
	two fundamental aspects of the history of engineers
		the history of social framework for engineers
		the history of the technical innovations

	extreme diversity of fields of engineering
		civil, mechanical, electrical, ...

	extreme diversity of responsibilities for engineers
		technical functions
		management


Questions Addressed
	What defines engineering history?
	Is the history of engineers primarily about the engineering profession and its evolution,or is it about the evolution of innovation and technical achievements?


Theses
	Engineering looks more like a continent marked by striking contrasts than like a unified field. On this continent, no self-evident link seems to exist between the organization of the profession and the various activities engineers are involved in.

	The lack of relations between these two fundamental aspects of the history of engneers is partly attributable to the extreme diversity of their jobs and realizations. Besides the distance that separates civil, mechanical or electrical engineering, engineers—since the second half of the 19th century at least—have occupied all kinds of positions between purely technical functions and management responsibilities.
