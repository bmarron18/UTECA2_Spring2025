White Papers / 
Reviews
################

White papers and review papers, while both in-depth reports, differ significantly in purpose and target audience.

White Paper
		+ Persuasive, industry-focused reports aiming to educate and persuade potential stakeholders
        + Designed to educate and persuade a specific audience (often potential customers) about a particular product, 
		service, or viewpoint
        + Presents a problem, explores potential solutions, and often advocates for a specific approach or technology, 
		using facts and logic to support its claims.
        + Typically not peer-reviewed, and often written by marketing or internal company personnel.

Reviews (Science, Engineering, Medicine, etc)
       + Designed to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of existing research on a specific topic, for 
	    researchers, academics, and other experts in the relevant field
       + Summarizes, analyzes, and critically evaluates existing research, identifying key findings, gaps in knowledge, 
	    and areas for future research.
       + Typically peer-reviewed by experts in the field, ensuring the quality and validity of the research presented
