Consulting:
Clients, Transmittals, and Deliverables
####################

Marron's Rules for Consultants
-------------------------------
	1. NEVER give your client a draft. Only release your ABSOLUTE BEST WORK. 
	Remember, "God is in the details." (if you must break this rule, watermark every page of every 
	document with the word, DRAFT and state in the transmittal that the draft was per client request)

	2. Keep records of ALL client interactions (phone calls, email, casual conversations, etc. DOCUMENT 
	EVERYTHING!)
	
	3. Archive, Archive, Archive!
	
	4. Be real but absolutely professional AT ALL TIMES.
	
	5. Written communications must ALWAYS be at the highest level of professionalism.


A transmittal is a formal action. A transmittal is the act of sending your clinet your finished product. A transmittal includes:
	i) 	a transmittal letter; and
	ii) the deliverable(s) (your finished product)


The transmittal letter:
	+ a formal cover letter that accompanies a larger document or package, introducing the document and 
	providing context or instructions for the recipient
	
	+ standard business letter format, with a clear and concise tone
	
	+ explanations, instructions, new info (as needed)
	
	+ "Do not hesitate to call..." statement
	
	+ "thank you (appreciation)" statement (as appropriate)


The Deliverable(s):
	+ Triple-edited for typos and for accuracy
	+ Attached to transmittal letter or drive address to files
