	RFI (Request for Information)
		a formal business process used to gather information from potential suppliers about their capabilities, products, 
		or services, typically in the early stages of a procurement process, before issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) 
		or Request for Quotation (RFQ). The primary goal of an RFI is to gather market intelligence and understand the 
		offerings of potential vendors before making a purchasing decision


	RFQ (Request for Quotes)
	a formal document used to solicit price quotes or bids from potential suppliers or vendors for specific products or 
	services, typically when the buyer has well-defined requirements and is primarily focused on obtaining the best price 
	The primary goal of an RFQ is to obtain competitive pricing information from multiple suppliers for a specific 
	product or service

	RFPs (Request for Proposals)
		a formal document used to solicit detailed proposals from potential vendors for complex goods or services, 
		allowing them to showcase their expertise and approach alongside pricing. RFPs are used when the buyer needs a 
		more detailed proposal outlining how a vendor would approach fulfilling their needs. An RFP typically outlines 
		the project scope, requirements, evaluation criteria, and timeline for proposals0

White papers and review papers, while both in-depth reports, differ significantly in purpose and target audience: white papers are persuasive, industry-focused reports aiming to educate and persuade potential customers, while review papers are scholarly, peer-reviewed articles summarizing existing research for experts in a field

White Paper 
    Purpose:
    To educate and persuade a specific audience (often potential customers) about a particular product, service, or viewpoint, often used in business-to-business (B2B) marketing.
    Content:
    Presents a problem, explores potential solutions, and often advocates for a specific approach or technology, using facts and logic to support its claims.
    Audience:
    Potential customers, industry professionals, or stakeholders who may be influenced by the information presented.
    Peer Review:
    Typically not peer-reviewed, and often written by marketing or internal company personnel.

Review Paper 
    Purpose:
    To provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of existing research on a specific topic, for academic or research purposes.
    Content:
    Summarizes, analyzes, and critically evaluates existing research, identifying key findings, gaps in knowledge, and areas for future research.
    Audience:
    Researchers, academics, and other experts in the relevant field.
    Peer Review:
    Typically peer-reviewed by experts in the field, ensuring the quality and validity of the research presented.
