############################

--- Overview
A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a set of written instructions that document a
routine or repetitive activity followed by an organization. The development and use of SOPs are
an integral part of a successful quality system as it provides individuals with the information to
perform a job properly, and facilitates consistency in the quality and integrity of a product or
end-result.

--- Purpose
SOPs detail the regularly recurring work processes that are to be conducted or followed
within an organization. They document the way activities are to be performed to facilitate
consistent conformance to technical and quallity system requirements and to support data quality.

--- Benefits
The development and use of SOPs minimizes variation and promotes quality through
consistent implementation of a process or procedure within the organization, even if there are
temporary or permanent personnel changes. SOPs can indicate compliance with organizational 
and governmental requirements and can be used as a part of a personnel training program, since
they should provide detailed work instructions. It minimizes opportunities for
miscommunication and can address safety concerns.
