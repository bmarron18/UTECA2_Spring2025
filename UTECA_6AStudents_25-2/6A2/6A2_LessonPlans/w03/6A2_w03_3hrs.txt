HW_03.1		[Due: 6 Feb 2025]
Write extended and complete definitions (in both English and Spanish) for the following terms and concepts:
	System
		(open, closed, isolated, boundary, surroundings, interactions/flows, state, properties)
		
	Intensive property
		(temperature, pressure, velocity, density)
		
	Extensive property
		(mass, charge, linear momentum, angular momentum, energy, and entropy)

	Conservation laws
		(mass, charge, linear momentum, angular momentum, energy)
		
 As a point of reference see p 29-32, *Richards_BASIC-ENGINEERING-SCIENCE.pdf. The standard format applies.
