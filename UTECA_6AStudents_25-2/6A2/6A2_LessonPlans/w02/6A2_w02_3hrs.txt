HW_02.1 [Due: 30Jan2025]
Take about five or six lines from your favorite poem, music lyric, prose, or "dicho" and jargonize it. Make the phrases as complicated as possible. In your written document (i.e., your homework paper) you must provide the following:
		i) The original material and its source
		ii) Your jargonized version of the original in both English and Spanish
		
Standard format applies. We will try to guess the original when you read the jargonized version in class.


HW_02.2	[Due: 30Jan2025]
Investigate the mental process that engineers and scientists use to solve a problem. More specifically, 
	i) Given a design or conceptual problem, what is a first step that engineers and scientists are likely to take? Why?
	ii) What are the accepted foundations for conceptualizing a problem? That is, what is the worldview or the overarching mental model that lies at the very foundation of science and engineering? What are the components of this worldview?
	iii) What ASSUMPTIONS are made, consciously or not, when engineers and scientists begin modeling a problem?
	iv) When are models useful for reaching a soluton to a problem? If no solution presents itself what can the engineer or scientist do?
	
The results of your investigations will be delivered in a two-page paper. The original paper is to be written in English and you must provide a Spanish translation. Standard format applies and references must be included.

On Jargon
"SCIENTIFIC JARGON, GOOD AND BAD" by Russel Hirst
J. TECHNICAL WRITING AND COMMUNICATION, Vol. 33(3) 201-229, 2003

To be, or the contrary? Whether the former or the latter be preferable would
seem to admit of some difference of opinion; the answer in the present case
being of an affirmative or of a negative character according as to whether one
elects on the one hand to mentally suffer the disfavour of fortune, albeit in
an extreme degree, or on the other to boldly envisage adverse conditions in
the prospect of eventually bringing them to a conclusion 


[To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them.]
	-- Hamlet

--------------

Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion
that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be
commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the
unpredictable must invariably be taken into account

Ecclesiastes 9:11
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle
to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of under-
standing, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth
to them all.



Jargon (positive; "good jargon")
	* the specialized language of any trade, organization, profession, or science
	* specialized vocabularies
	* proper and effective use of scientific and technical terms

Jargon (negative; "bad jargon")
	* the pretentious, excluding, evasive, or othenvise unethical and offensive 
	use of specialized vocabulary
	* showy or shoddy use of language
	* technical terms and phrases invented by a Government departments hich are understood 	
	inside the department but are unintelligible to outsiders ("bureacratese,"). Usually a 
	mixture of technical terms, words used in a special sense, plus acronyms
	
Scientific jargon
	* the many thousands of words and phrases often appropriated from Latin and Greek in 
	order to name (or re-name) the tools, machines, processes, substances, structures, 
	properties, causes, effects, laws, objects, animals, minerals, and vegetables that 
	scientists and engineers study and manipulate.


Jargon vs Style
	* Scientific jargon does not constitute a separate language, nor can "scientific language" 
	in any sense, broad or narrow, legitimately stand aloof from the rules of good style that 
	govern other kinds of discourse. 
	* Scientific and technical discourse in its various manifestations does have legitimate 
	distinguishing features, including accepted methods of arguing, organizing, illustrating, 
	and designing communications.
	

Jargon vs. "Fat"
	Due to the fact that the compressor ceased functioning prior to our finalization of the work 
	project,we informed the contracting party at that point in time that unless he agreed to 
	convey a functioning compressor to our job site free of additional charge or cost to us, we 
	would render null and void our contract with him
	
	Since the compressor broke down before we finished the job, we told the contractor to bring 
	us another one, at no extra cost, or we 'd cancel our contract with him.

Getting to Good Jargon
	* Aldous Huxley said that if a person really knows the subject, "s/he will be able to speak 
	of it in an easy language and with the completeness of conviction with which s/he talks of 
	an ordinary every-day matter. If s/he does not, s/he will be afraid to wander beyond the 
	limits of the technical phraseology which he has got up"
	
	1. It is economical (condenses complex ideas into few words).
	2. It is precise (uses Latinate vocabulary to name things not accurately named, nor not 
	named at all, in common speech).
	3. It is stable (not much influenced by vernacular, fickle cultural changes, language 
	shifts).
	4. It is flexible (Greek and Latin are excellent sources for synthetic vocabulary).
	5. It is nearly universal (because of the dominance of Latin and Greek,  passages of jargon-
	filled scientific prose are largely intelligible to fellownscientists around the world even 
	if they are not familiar with the primary language ofthe writer).
	6. It enhances cohesion among the sciences 
	7. It connects us with previous scientific thought (Greek and Latin scientists and 
	subsequent thinkers using Latin/Greek in their treatises).
	8. It is prose that conserves the reader's mental energy 
	
Jargon in Style
	* Use no more words than are necessary to express your meaning
	* do not use superfluous adjectives and adverbs and do not use roundabout phrases where 
	single words would serve
	* Use words with a precise meaning rather than https://www.merriam-
	webster.com/grammar/rhetorical-devices-list-examplesthose that are vague
	




Language Structures and Functions in Engineering 
	(from Richards', BASIC-ENGINEERING-SCIENCE p 9-11; p 16-20)

	Look at a standard curriculum

	Look at language structures used by engineers
	Language structure create mental models
	The structures are a result of:
			*natural laws and mathematics as a common language
			*the methodology and process of problem solving using heuristics and models
			*developing models from fundamental principles (the hallmark of engineering courses)
		

	Look at the engineer's mental paradigm
		*analysis (models) and design (models)
		*Nature (and problems) are studied with models
		*ASSUMES natural laws and mathematics can yield useful models for MOST problems
		*

	A model is a purposeful representation of reality.
