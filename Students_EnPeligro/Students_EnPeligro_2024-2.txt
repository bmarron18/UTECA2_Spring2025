Hi Viri! And Happy Valentine's Day!

Just a heads up that some students will receive low marks this term, and some may actually fail because they did not take the first exam. I'll go in numerical class order.

In 5C, all of these students were absent and did not take the exam; they are at risk of failing the term. Only Iris has contacted me to request a new exam time. I'm not sure how this will work given that grades are due this Tues.
CONTRERAS VELAZQUEZ MIRIAM SARAHI (Iris)
MONTERO TOLEDO MARGARITA ABIGAIL
RAMOS BALLESTEROS SOFIA 
SANDOVAL GARCIA SOFIA DEL ANGEL

In 6A, these students have missed multiple assignments. Uri and Carlos have made up a few of them.
